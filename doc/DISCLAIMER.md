## Installation
Before installing, read the [Hubzilla installation instructions](https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core/blob/master/install/INSTALL.txt) for important information about:

### Register a new domain and add it to YunoHost
- Hubzilla requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As Hubzilla uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as hubzilla.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.

## Ldap Admin user rights, logs and failed database updates

- **For admin rights**: When installation is complete, you will need to visit your new hub's page and login with the **admin account username** which was entered at the time of installation process. You should then be able to create your first channel and have the **admin rights** for the hub.

- **For normal YunoHost users**: Normal LDAP users can login through LDAP authentication and create there channels.

- **Failing to get admin rights**: If the admin cannot access the admin settings at `https://hubzilla.example.com/admin` then you have to **manually add 4096** to the **account_roles** under **accounts** for that user in the **database through phpMyAdmin**.

- **For logs**: Go to **admin->logs** and enter the file name **php.log**.

- **Failed Database after Upgrade:** Some times databse upgrade fails after version upgrade. You can go to hub eg. `https://hubzilla.example.com/admin/dbsync/` and check the numbers of failled update. These updates will have to be ran manually by **phpMyAdmin**.
